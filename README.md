# vMOCO
A visualization tool for the nondominated frontiers of multi-objective integer programming problems. The underlying motivation behind this application is to provide a ready-to-use visualization tools
for the ones working on multi-criteria decision making problems.

## Getting Started
This application has been built on the Shiny web application framework provided by RStudio. In this repository, we provide the source code
specific to the three-dimensional data. It can also be used for two-dimensional data by creating an artificial additional dimension to your points.
For higher dimensions, the source code can be easily modified by the ones familiar with the R language.

### Prerequisites

In order to be able to get the application running, you need to first download [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). 
You can dowload the free desktop version. Once you installed the RStudio on your computer, you should follow these steps:

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
